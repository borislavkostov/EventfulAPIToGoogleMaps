Starts off with a blast of Zappa then shifts into some Deep Purple territory: very few acts could pull off the prog with frantic horns & punk vox & acid guitar, too many chops required. Now I&#39;m listening to the trippy flutey Spin A Yarn ... this is all very feasible stuff. Now I want a motorcycle, and some cocaine, and bellbottoms, a black leather vest, and a shotgun, and a deep skin diver--whoo! I&#39;m open to which ever comes first...like playing Pink Floyd to the Wizard of Oz, I wanna play this music and watch Easy Rider, Saturday Night Fever, or Clockwork Orange...damn, this should be done immediately. I&#39;m supposed to go there but family obligations are keeping me home, but this tune is Roadhouse Blues-y like Doors w/ Jesus Just Left Chicago overtones ... Ian Paice&#39;s son on Battery stuck in Traffic with Edgar Broughton driving, impressive sounds, push this music out to the people. Dramatic, yes, yeah, loved it brother :-) -B. Cruzan, 2016From Creative Loafing&#39;s Crib Notes:Today, Crib Notes is proud to unveil &quot;Nobody Asked,&quot; the debut single from Frosted Orange, a group featuring longtime Atlanta music vets Mathis Hunter (voice, guitar), Ben Davis (saxophone), Rich Morris (keys), Lee Corrum (drums), and Andy Morrison (bass). For those who are unfamiliar that&#39;s 3/5 ex-Noot d&#39; Noot, 2/3 Purkinje Shift, and one former Nashville session musician. And that&#39;s just from recent memory. This crew has ties to countless Atlanta bands from the last two decades.&quot;Nobody Asked&quot; is a driving collision of funk and psychedelic hard rock, sprinkled with saxophone freak outs that disguise themselves as an allegiance to Afro beat. But these dudes are all about the rock in a Deep Purple meets Sun Ra kind of way.The song was written and recorded by Frosted Orange at Alpha Centauri, and is set to appear on the group&#39;s self-titled album, which lands on June 4.&quot;TICKETING & RESERVATION INFO:Purchasing a General Admission ticket does not guarantee a seat/table.Table seating is considered General Admission and is reserved on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Born to a single mother of 5, living on welfare in a tough West end neighborhood of Atlanta, Ms. Pat learned early on she would have to fend for herself in this world. Her Grandfather ran a “bootleg” house where as a kid Pat learned how to roll the drunks for food money. She had her first child at 14 and her second child at 15, “I knew I wasn’t going to college so I figured why not get an early start on my family”. She became a drug dealer in her teens known by the street name “Rabbit”. “I figured there were two things I could do in my neighborhood to earn money, either sell drugs or sell p*@#$y”. At 16 she purchased her first Cadillac. During her teens she was shot twice and arrested numerous times. At 19 years of age she met a man, and with his help and encouragement decided to get out of the “life”. “I was so tired, I thought for sure I was going to end up dead. He was 21 and a military vet and he showed me a way out”.<p>At 19 with two toddlers and a new husband she is handed 4 more young children from her sister who was struggling with drug addiction. The next 10 years of her life are spent raising those 6 children. Part of that process included visits to the welfare office for food stamps and Section 8 housing assistance for her sister’s children. It was during these visits that Ms. Pat was first told she had a talent for telling funny stories. In 2003 with her case-worker’s encouragement she decided to go on stage and appeared at the Open-Mic-Night at “The Pub” in Atlanta. From the moment she stepped on stage she knew she had found her place. She began pouring punch lines across stages at the rate other moms pour milk at the counter.<p>With a comedy career now spilling over 9 years this powerful woman brings an honest, in your face, and hilarious perspective to her shows. She has appeared on TV Guide Network’s “Standup in Stilettos”, and Nickelodeons “Mom’s Night Out”. She has an upcoming appearance on BET’s “Comicview” this fall. She is a regular guest on the syndicated Bob and Tom Radio Show, and appears on Katt Williams DVD “Kattpacalypse”.<p>She has become a Podcast celebrity with appearances on TalkinS hit with Eddie Ifft, WTF with Marc Maron, The Joe Rogan Experience, Ari Shafir’s Skeptic Tank, The CrabFeast with Ryan Sickler and Jay Larson, and Your Mom’s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura, the Bertcast with Bert Kreischer.<p>In January of 2015 she appeared on Comedy Central’s “This is Not Happening” and will be on the 2015 of NBC’s “Last Comic Standing”.<p>Ms. Pat currently resides with her husband and three children in Indianapolis.</p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-05-05 06:54:48","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Ms Pat","venue_address":"878 Peachtree Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/026/286/996-3.jpeg_/ms-pat-96.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/026/286/996-3.jpeg_/ms-pat-96.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/026/286/996-3.jpeg_/ms-pat-96.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/026/286/996-3.jpeg_/ms-pat-96.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-02-25 02:59:50","venue_id":"V0-001-000954054-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Laughing Skull Lounge Theater","venue_url":"http://atlanta.eventful.com/venues/laughing-skull-lounge-theater-/V0-001-000954054-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"GA","postal_code":"30326","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.8481222","groups":null,"url":"http://atlanta.eventful.com/events/womens-council-realtors-may-meeting-howprospect-/E0-001-093202166-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093202166-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Atlanta","link_count":null,"longitude":"-84.3670410","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Georgia","start_time":"2016-05-19 11:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Join us as Diane Bryant presents... &quot;How Prospecting Can Change Your Life and Your Income Dramatically&quot; Join us as Diane Bryant (Coach and Realtor with Berkshire Hathaway) shares her Journey and Philosophy on PROSPECTING.

When they say, &#39;If you love what you do, you never work again&#39; puts in a nutshell Dianne&#39;s joy for having a Real Estate License and helping people. With two adult children, four grandchildren and a Seminary Diploma, Dianne set out to build a new life and career for herself.  In her first year, her piers deemed her successful by giving her the award as 2004 Rookie of the Year for the Dekalb Board.

In 2007 she found the right Business Model for her personality and lifestyle. She then never looked back. She has become one of the top producing agents in The Dekalb Board for the past 4 years and in her Company Berkshire Hathaway Homes Services Ga Properties since its launch in Atlanta.

The event will be held in the Moon River Beer Garden and will feature a recreational bike ride leaving Ellis Square at 1 p.m., following a press conference featuring local and state officials. The Matt’s Moon River Cruise party features live music, a raffle (must be present to win), a silent auction, a special beer brewed in Matt’s honor, a special tasting of local beers and valet parking for bicycles. Tickets are $20 and available at the door on May 14. Buy tickets online and receive a limited edition Matt’s Moon River Cruise t-shirt. Proceeds will benefit the Savannah Bicycle Campaign and Georgia Bikes! The goal is to educate the public on how to safely share the road with cyclists and promote efforts to make our streets safer for people who ride bikes.
